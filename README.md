# Contributing Words
Words can be added into the `$first`, `$second` or `$third` array in `words.php`. The array they are put into will change the position they appear in. A new word should always be added to the end of the array to preserve existing links.

# Contributing Definitions
To contribute a definition, add it to the array in `define.php`. The key should be the word, exactly as it appears in the `words.php` file. The value should be the definition of the word.
